# CAMODetectionW_CosmicFilaments
This repository contains our data-processing scripts and code used to transform radio-data using FITS images using FtBg to detect Camouflaged objects in RGB format.
Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) data format is used by Astronomers to analyze data in radio-wave and microwave formats. From https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000317.shtml :
The term "image" in the standard's name is loosely applied and FITS files often contain only non-image data. Astronomers view their images as data for analysis rather than simply as pictures to look at. From its beginning, FITS was seen as a transport format for more than a still image intended for printing or viewing in two dimensions. FITS was designed to facilitate the unambiguous transmission of n-dimensional regularly spaced data arrays, an n-cube. These multi-dimensional arrays may be 1-D spectra, 2-D images or data cubes of three or more dimensions. Two-dimensional tables containing rows and columns of data can also be stored in a FITS file. The substantial use of FITS for data that even astronomers would not class as image data led to consideration to change the full name for the FITS format, but the proposal was rejected. For the same reason, in this resource, FITS is categorized primarily as a dataset format, with use for image data as secondary.
